# js-ts

This repo contains my personal notes for learning JavaScript adn TypeScript

## JavaScript

Notes are gathered from the [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/) and also the github repo [here](https://github.com/mdn/content).

The specific dynamic scripting js tutorial available online [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) with the github repo [here](https://github.com/mdn/content/tree/main/files/en-us/learn_web_development/core/scripting).

The frameworks tutorial is found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries) with the repo found [here](https://github.com/mdn/content/tree/main/files/en-us/learn_web_development/core/frameworks_libraries)

This [tutorial](https://javascript.info/) is also another great reference

## TypeScript

We will be using the official documentation [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
